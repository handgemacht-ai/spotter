In your analysis process:\n\n1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation. For each section thoroughly identify:\n   - The user's explicit requests and intents\n   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests\n   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns\n   - Specific details like:\n     - file names\n     - full code snippets\n     - function signatures\n     - file edits\n  - Errors that you ran into and how you fixed them\n  - Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.\n2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.\n\nYour summary should include the following sections:\n\n1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail\n2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.\n3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include full code snippets where applicable and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.\n4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.\n5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.\n6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. These are critical for understanding the users' feedback and changing intent.\n6. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.\n7. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant. Include file names and code snippets where applicable.\n8. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent work you were doing. IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's most recent explicit requests, and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request. If your last task was concluded, then only list next steps if they are explicitly in line with the users request. Do not start on tangential requests or really old requests that were already completed without confirming with the user first.\n                       If there is a next step, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off. This should be verbatim to ensure there's no drift in task interpretation.\n\nHere's an example of how your output should be structured:\n\n<example>\n<analysis>\n[Your thought process, ensuring all points are covered thoroughly and accurately]\n</analysis>\n\n<summary>\n1.

If so, remember to follow these instructions when creating the above summary. Examples of instructions include:\n<example>\n## Compact Instructions\nWhen summarizing the conversation focus on typescript code changes and also remember the mistakes you made and how you fixed them.\n</example>\n\n<example>\n# Summary instructions\nWhen you are using compact - please focus on test output and code changes. Include file reads verbatim.\n</example>\n\n\nAdditional Instructions:\n# Beads Workflow Context\n\n> **Context Recovery**: Run `bd prime` after compaction, clear, or new session\n> Hooks auto-call this in Claude Code when .beads/ detected\n\n# 🚨 SESSION CLOSE PROTOCOL 🚨\n\n**CRITICAL**: Before saying \"done\" or \"complete\", you MUST run this checklist:\n\n```\n[ ] 1. git status              (check what changed)\n[ ] 2. git add <files>         (stage code changes)\n[ ] 3. bd sync --from-main     (pull beads updates from main)\n[ ] 4. git commit -m \"...\"     (commit code changes)\n```\n\n**Note:** This is an ephemeral branch (no upstream). Code is merged to main locally, not pushed.\n\n## Core Rules\n- **Default**: Use beads for ALL task tracking (`bd create`, `bd ready`, `bd close`)\n- **Prohibited**: Do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown files for task tracking\n- **Workflow**: Create beads issue BEFORE writing code, mark in_progress when starting\n- Persistence you don't need beats lost context\n- Git workflow: run `bd sync --from-main` at session end\n- Session management: check `bd ready` for available work\n\n## Essential Commands\n\n### Finding Work\n- `bd ready` - Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n- `bd list --status=open` - All open issues\n- `bd list --status=in_progress` - Your active work\n- `bd show <id>` - Detailed issue view with dependencies\n\n### Creating & Updating\n- `bd create --title=\"Summary of this issue\" --description=\"Why this issue exists and what needs to be done\" --type=task|bug|feature --priority=2` - New issue\n  - Priority: 0-4 or P0-P4 (0=critical, 2=medium, 4=backlog). NOT \"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"\n- `bd update <id> --status=in_progress` - Claim work\n- `bd update <id> --assignee=username` - Assign to someone\n- `bd update <id> --title/--description/--notes/--design` - Update fields inline\n- `bd close <id>` - Mark complete\n- `bd close <id1> <id2> ...` - Close multiple issues at once (more efficient)\n- `bd close <id> --reason=\"explanation\"` - Close with reason\n- **Tip**: When creating multiple issues/tasks/epics, use parallel subagents for efficiency\n- **WARNING**: Do NOT use `bd edit` - it opens $EDITOR (vim/nano) which blocks agents\n\n### Dependencies & Blocking\n- `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` - Add dependency (issue depends on depends-on)\n- `bd blocked` - Show all blocked issues\n- `bd show <id>` - See what's blocking/blocked by this issue\n\n### Sync & Collaboration\n- `bd sync --from-main` - Pull beads updates from main (for ephemeral branches)\n- `bd sync --status` - Check sync status without syncing\n\n### Project Health\n- `bd stats` - Project statistics (open/closed/blocked counts)\n- `bd doctor` - Check for issues (sync problems, missing hooks)\n\n## Common Workflows\n\n**Starting work:**\n```bash\nbd ready           # Find available work\nbd show <id>       # Review issue details\nbd update <id> --status=in_progress  # Claim it\n```\n\n**Completing work:**\n```bash\nbd close <id1> <id2> ...    # Close all completed issues at once\nbd sync --from-main         # Pull latest beads from main\ngit add . && git commit -m \"...\"  # Commit your changes\n# Merge to main when ready (local merge, not push)\n```\n\n**Creating dependent work:**\n```bash\n# Run bd create commands in parallel (use subagents for many items)\nbd create --title=\"Implement feature X\" --description=\"Why this issue exists and what needs to be done\" --type=feature\nbd create --title=\"Write tests for X\" --description=\"Why this issue exists and what needs to be done\" --type=task\nbd dep add beads-yyy beads-xxx  # Tests depend on Feature (Feature blocks tests)\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT use any tools.

Problem Solving:\n   - Designed parallel enriched code path to avoid breaking `render_message/1` backward compatibility while adding rich metadata to `render/2`\n   - Used state machine pattern for fenced code block detection in `classify_text_lines`\n   - Used simple string prefix replacement (`relativize_in_text`) for safe path relativization instead of regex\n   - Handled tool threading with deterministic fallback keys (\"tool-use-#{name}\" and \"unmatched-result\")\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"Work on bead spotter-fum. Run bd show spotter-fum to see the issue details and bd ready to find available subtasks. Start with the first ready task.\"\n   - (Plan mode approval - implicit)\n   - System reminders about Credo linting issues (treated as automated feedback)\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - **spotter-fum.3** (IN PROGRESS): \"Integrate highlight.js for transcript code blocks in LiveView lifecycle\" — code changes made but NOT yet compiled, tested, or committed\n   - **spotter-fum.4** (OPEN, was blocked by fum.2 and fum.3): \"Add regression coverage for renderer metadata, SessionLive UX, and JS highlighting behavior\"\n\n8. Current Work:\n   Working on `spotter-fum.3`. All code changes have been made:\n   - Installed highlight.js npm package\n   - Updated `assets/js/app.js` with hljs imports, `highlightTranscriptCode()` function, and `Hooks.TranscriptHighlighter` hook\n   - Updated `session_live.ex` template with `phx-hook=\"TranscriptHighlighter\"`, `data-render-mode` attribute, and conditional `<pre><code>` rendering for code rows\n   - Updated `spotter.css` with highlight.js light theme and code block styles\n   \n   **NOT YET DONE**: compile check, test run, credo check, bd close, git commit.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Complete spotter-fum.3 by running `mix compile`, `mix test`, `mix credo`, then `bd close spotter-fum.3` and commit. Then proceed to spotter-fum.4 (\"Add regression coverage for renderer metadata, SessionLive UX, and JS highlighting behavior\").\n   \n   The user's original request was: \"Work on bead spotter-fum. Run bd show spotter-fum to see the issue details and bd ready to find available subtasks. Start with the first ready task.\" — I've been working through all subtasks sequentially. Last action was adding highlight.js theme CSS to `spotter.css` for spotter-fum.3.\n</summary>"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2814,"cache_read_input_tokens":167093,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":2814},"output_tokens":6,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY35CSeDWNxBG555FLFMu","type":"assistant","uuid":"28a40c09-b999-4c1f-9cfe-0d9ecbd4c26c","timestamp":"2026-02-11T22:31:35.216Z"}
