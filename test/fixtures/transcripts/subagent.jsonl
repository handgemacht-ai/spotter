Do NOT explore code beyond what's needed for accurate bead descriptions.\n\n**Arguments**: websearch to learn how to fastest setup credo, dialyzer, mix_audit (basically all supported by https://github.com/bradleygolden/claude-marketplace-elixir)\n\nMaybe there are igniter scripts?\n\n## Instructions\n\nFollow these phases in strict order. DO NOT create any beads until the user explicitly approves the plan.\n\n### Phase 1: Understand Input\n\nParse `websearch to learn how to fastest setup credo, dialyzer, mix_audit (basically all supported by https://github.com/bradleygolden/claude-marketplace-elixir)\n\nMaybe there are igniter scripts?` for either:\n- A **description** of what to create (e.g., \"user authentication system\")\n- A **file path** to a spec, pitch, or design document\n\nIf a file path is provided, read it. If the description is vague or missing key details, use AskUserQuestion to clarify scope, target area, and constraints before proceeding.\n\n**Rig prefix**: Ask which rig these beads belong to (e.g., `aufgabenschmiede`, `control_panel`, `deacon`). The rig prefix determines where beads are stored and routed. If the arguments or file path make the rig obvious, confirm it; otherwise ask explicitly.\n\n### Phase 2: Explore (if needed)\n\nIf the work references existing code or integrates with existing systems:\n- Use Glob/Grep/Read to explore the codebase\n- Identify exact file paths, patterns, and architecture\n- This informs accurate task descriptions with real paths (not guesses)\n\nSkip this phase if the work is greenfield with no existing code dependencies.\n\n### Phase 3: Draft Bead Content\n\nUse the Task tool with `subagent_type=Plan` to draft the **complete bead content** — not summaries, but the exact descriptions that will be written into each bead. The Plan agent must produce:\n\n1. **Epic description** (the epic IS the pitch — it contains everything needed to understand why and what):\n\n   ```\n   ## Problem\n   [What's broken or missing? Why does it matter now?]\n\n   ## Solution\n   [Rough description of the approach — fat-marker sketches, not wireframes]\n\n   ## Acceptance Tests\n   - GIVEN [setup state] WHEN [action] THEN [expected outcome]\n   - ...\n\n   ## Rabbit Holes\n   [Tricky areas where complexity could explode scope]\n\n   ## No-gos\n   [What we're explicitly NOT doing — scope fences]\n\n   ---\n   Rig: [rig-prefix]. Appetite: [automated|reviewed|supervised].\n   Target: [directory]. Architecture: [constraints]. Sources: [file paths].\n   ```\n\n2. **Full task descriptions** — for each task, draft the **complete description text** that will go into `bd create --description`. Each task description MUST include all of the following sections (per bead quality standards):\n\n   - Opening paragraph: what to do and why\n   - **Output files**: exact paths to create or modify\n   - **Technical specs**: exact values, config syntax, API patterns, function signatures\n   - **Component usage**: which components/imports are needed and where they come from\n   - **Source references**: full paths to existing files to read before implementing\n   - **Edge cases**: encoding, compatibility, error handling specifics\n   - **Architecture constraints**: framework patterns, naming conventions\n   - **Definition of Done**: include ONLY the items relevant to this task (from the full DoD list below). The assignee MUST check all included items.\n\n   Do NOT write summaries. Write the actual spec that an agent will execute from.\n\n   **Definition of Done (full list; include only relevant items in each task bead):**\n   - All requirements in the task description are implemented.\n   - For unrelated changes, new beads with label:refinement were created. No unrelated changes were implemented.\n   - Tests to verify the behaviour exist or were added, and executed and pass.\n\n3. **Dependencies**: which tasks block which others\n\n4. **Validate** each task against the Self-Contained Task Checklist (see reference below)\n\n### Phase 4: Present Full Bead Content (CHECKPOINT)\n\nPresent the **exact content** that will be written into each bead. The user must see the full spec, not a summary table. Use this format:\n\n```\n## Proposed Beads\n\n### Epic: [Title]\n\n**Description** (this is what goes into the epic bead):\n\n> ## Problem\n> [Full problem statement]\n>\n> ## Solution\n> [Full solution description]\n>\n> ## Acceptance Tests\n> - GIVEN ... WHEN ... THEN ...\n>\n> ## Rabbit Holes\n> [Full list]\n>\n> ## No-gos\n> [Full list]\n>\n> ---\n> Rig: [prefix]. Appetite: [level]. Target: [dir]. Architecture: [constraints]. Sources: [paths].\n\n---\n\n### Task 1: [Title]\nDepends on: —\n\n**Description** (this is what goes into the task bead):\n\n> [Full multi-paragraph description with all sections:\n> output files, technical specs, component usage,\n> source references, edge cases, architecture constraints,\n> definition of done (only relevant items).\n> This is the EXACT text that will be passed to bd create.]\n\n---\n\n### Task 2: [Title]\nDepends on: Task 1\n\n**Description** (this is what goes into the task bead):\n\n> [Full description — same level of detail as above]\n\n---\n(repeat for all tasks)\n```\n\n**Critical**: The quoted description blocks must contain the EXACT text that will be written into the beads. No summaries, no \"see above\", no abbreviations. What the user sees is what gets created.\n\nThen call `EnterPlanMode`, write the full bead content to the plan file, and call `ExitPlanMode` to request user approval. The user can approve, reject, or provide feedback through the plan mode UI.\n\nIf the user rejects with feedback, incorporate it and re-present. Repeat until approved or cancelled.\n\n**Important**: Use AskUserQuestion only for clarifying questions in Phase 1/2. Plan approval MUST go through ExitPlanMode.\n\n### Phase 5: Create Beads (only after plan approval)\n\n1. Create the epic (use `--rig` to route to the correct rig). Copy the description verbatim from the approved plan:\n```bash\nbd create --title=\"[Epic title]\" --type=epic --priority=[0-4] --rig=[rig-prefix] --description=\"[EXACT description from the approved plan — copy verbatim]\"\n```\n\n2. Create each task as a child of the epic. Copy descriptions verbatim from the approved plan:\n```bash\nbd create --title=\"[Task title]\" --type=task --priority=[0-4] --parent=[epic-id] --description=\"[EXACT description from the approved plan — copy verbatim]\"\n```\n\n3. Set up dependencies:\n```bash\nbd dep add [task-id] [depends-on-id]\n```\n\n4. Present the final summary:\n```\n## Beads Created\n\nEpic [epic-id]: [title]\n\n| Bead ID | Task | Depends On |\n|---------|------|-----------|\n| [id] | [title] | — |\n| [id] | [title] | [id] |\n\nRun `bd ready` to see available work.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Reference: Bead Quality Standards\n\nApply these standards during Phase 3 (drafting) before presenting the plan.\n\n# Bead Quality Standards\n\nStandards for creating well-structured, self-contained beads that an agent can execute with zero outside context.\n\n## Self-Contained Task Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing any task description, include all of the following:\n\n- [ ] **Why** — Why this change is necessary (problem, pain point, or opportunity). Epics MUST have a why; tasks inherit from their epic but can add task-specific motivation\n- [ ] **Output files** — Exact file paths to create or modify\n- [ ] **Content/copy** — All text, data, and configuration verbatim. Never write \"see mockup\", \"German text here\", or \"TBD\"\n- [ ] **Technical specs** — Exact values: CSS tokens, timing numbers, config syntax, API patterns. No vague instructions\n- [ ] **Component usage** — Which components and imports are needed, and where they come from\n- [ ] **Source references** — Full paths to existing files, documentation, or other material to read. Use repo-relative paths (e.g., `aufgabenschmiede/lib/...`). Never reference rigs by name — always point to concrete file paths\n- [ ] **Code structure** — Class names, nesting, element attributes, function signatures\n- [ ] **Edge cases** — Encoding requirements, browser compatibility, accessibility attributes\n- [ ] **Architecture constraints** — Framework version, plugin config location, naming conventions\n\nEpics carry the full pitch and need: problem (why), solution (approach), acceptance tests (GIVEN/WHEN/THEN), rabbit holes, no-gos, appetite, target directory, architecture constraints, source references.\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\nAvoid these in bead descriptions:\n\n- \"See the plan for details\" or \"refer to the mockup\"\n- Missing output file paths\n- Descriptions that restate the title without adding specifics\n- Vague instructions: \"add appropriate styling\", \"configure correctly\", \"handle errors properly\"\n- \"German text\" without the actual German text included\n- Referencing other beads by ID without explaining what they provide\n- Referencing rigs by name — use repo-relative file paths instead\n- Missing animation timings, color values, or config syntax\n- Using `bd edit` (opens $EDITOR, blocks agents — use `bd update` with inline flags instead)\n\n## Quality Self-Check\n\nRun through these before finalizing. Every answer must pass.\n\n| Question | Pass if... |\n|----------|-----------|\n| Does the epic contain the full pitch? | Problem, solution, acceptance tests, rabbit holes, no-gos, appetite — all present |\n| Are output file paths listed? | Every file to create or modify is named with its full path |\n| Is all content included verbatim? | No placeholders, \"TBD\", or references to external sources |\n| Are technical values exact? | Specific numbers, tokens, syntax — nothing vague |\n| Are dependencies explicit? | Blocker bead IDs named, with what they provide |\n| Are source references listed? | Paths to material to read before implementing; no rig names, only file paths |\n| Could an agent execute this with zero context? | No clarifying questions needed |\n\nIf any question fails, enrich the bead description before proceeding.\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"dfd90414-3e19-4bc7-9503-d0e4d11f3fba","timestamp":"2026-02-10T21:54:53.186Z"}

A runtime config file (priv/spotter.toml) defines tracked projects with regex patterns to match transcript directories (handling worktrees). An Oban job reads the config, scans matching directories, parses JSONL, and upserts into SQLite.

It consists of:\n\n### 1 Epic (spotter-2qx)\n**\"Setup Code Quality Tools (Credo, Dialyxir, mix_audit)\"**\n- Clearly defines the Problem (no automated quality checks)\n- Explains the Solution (add three standard tools via Igniter)\n- Lists Acceptance Tests for verification\n- Documents Rabbit Holes (slow PLT build, strict rules)\n- Specifies No-gos (no CI integration yet, no custom checks)\n\n### 2 Focused Tasks\n\n**Task 1 (spotter-2qx.1): \"Install quality tools and configure Credo\"**\n- Uses `mix igniter.install` for fast setup\n- Generates Credo config with `mix credo gen.config`\n- Verification steps for all three tools\n- Clear definition of done\n\n**Task 2 (spotter-2qx.2): \"Add mix quality alias for unified tool execution\"**\n- Adds single `mix quality` command to run all three tools\n- Runs in sequence: credo → dialyzer → deps.audit\n- Minimal changes to mix.exs (just the aliases section)\n- Depends on Task 1 completing first\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n\n1. **Single Epic for 3 Dependencies**: This is not a major feature, so one small epic with 2 tasks is appropriate (not 3 separate tasks)\n2. **Igniter-First Approach**: Uses `mix igniter.install` to add deps cleanly (already confirmed igniter is a dev dependency in mix.exs)\n3. **Credo Defaults**: No custom rules initially—use generated .credo.exs\n4. **PLT Documentation**: Explicitly calls out that first dialyzer run is slow (don't optimize, just document)\n5. **Unified Alias**: One `mix quality` command makes it CI-friendly and developer-friendly\n6. **No Scope Creep**: CI integration, pre-commit hooks, and strict mode are explicitly marked as \"No-gos\" (future tasks)\n\nThe format matches the existing beads in `.beads/issues.jsonl` exactly, including all required fields and dependency structure."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: afb92ff (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 33894\ntool_uses: 9\nduration_ms: 38799</usage>"}]}]},"uuid":"ad8edfa3-c6cd-4fc3-ab58-50738a695ec9","timestamp":"2026-02-10T21:58:54.253Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Draft bead content for setting up Credo, Dialyxir, and mix_audit in an Elixir/Phoenix project called Spotter.\n\nContext:\n- Project at /home/marco/projects/spotter\n- mix.exs already has igniter as a dep\n- No rig prefix needed\n- None of these tools are currently installed\n- This is a simple setup task - likely a single task bead (no epic needed for 3 deps)\n\nThe fastest approach: `mix igniter.install credo dialyxir mix_audit` will add all three deps.

It consists of:\n\n### 1 Epic (spotter-2qx)\n**\"Setup Code Quality Tools (Credo, Dialyxir, mix_audit)\"**\n- Clearly defines the Problem (no automated quality checks)\n- Explains the Solution (add three standard tools via Igniter)\n- Lists Acceptance Tests for verification\n- Documents Rabbit Holes (slow PLT build, strict rules)\n- Specifies No-gos (no CI integration yet, no custom checks)\n\n### 2 Focused Tasks\n\n**Task 1 (spotter-2qx.1): \"Install quality tools and configure Credo\"**\n- Uses `mix igniter.install` for fast setup\n- Generates Credo config with `mix credo gen.config`\n- Verification steps for all three tools\n- Clear definition of done\n\n**Task 2 (spotter-2qx.2): \"Add mix quality alias for unified tool execution\"**\n- Adds single `mix quality` command to run all three tools\n- Runs in sequence: credo → dialyzer → deps.audit\n- Minimal changes to mix.exs (just the aliases section)\n- Depends on Task 1 completing first\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n\n1. **Single Epic for 3 Dependencies**: This is not a major feature, so one small epic with 2 tasks is appropriate (not 3 separate tasks)\n2. **Igniter-First Approach**: Uses `mix igniter.install` to add deps cleanly (already confirmed igniter is a dev dependency in mix.exs)\n3. **Credo Defaults**: No custom rules initially—use generated .credo.exs\n4. **PLT Documentation**: Explicitly calls out that first dialyzer run is slow (don't optimize, just document)\n5. **Unified Alias**: One `mix quality` command makes it CI-friendly and developer-friendly\n6. **No Scope Creep**: CI integration, pre-commit hooks, and strict mode are explicitly marked as \"No-gos\" (future tasks)\n\nThe format matches the existing beads in `.beads/issues.jsonl` exactly, including all required fields and dependency structure."}],"totalDurationMs":38799,"totalTokens":33894,"totalToolUseCount":9,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":892,"cache_read_input_tokens":29869,"output_tokens":3130,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":892,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[]}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"79ed4dd9-9c66-46f4-af77-d38ce0621136"}
